<h3>The <u><b>null</b></u> And The <u><b>null</b></u></h3>
<p>A <u><b>null</b></u> was making fun of the <u><b>null</b></u> one day for being so slow.</p>
<p>"Do you ever get anywhere?" he asked with a mocking laugh.</p>
<u><b>null</b></u> replied the <u><b>null</b></u> "but I get there <u><b>null</b></u> than you think. I'll run you a race and prove it."</p>
<p>The <u><b>null</b></u> was much <u><b>null</b></u> at the idea of <u><b>null</b></u> a race with the <u><b>null</b></u>. but for the fun of the thing he agreed. So the <u><b>null</b></u>, who has consented to act as judge, marked the distance yelled, <u><b>null</b></u>.</p>
<p>The <u><b>null</b></u> was soon far out of sight, and to make the <u><b>null</b></u> feel very deeply how rediculous it was for him to try a race with a <u><b>null</b></u>. he went off the course to practise <u><b>null</b></u> for <u><b>null</b></u> hours until the <u><b>null</b></u> should catch up.</p>
<p>The <u><b>null</b></u> meanwhile kept going slowly but steadily, and, after a time, passed the place where the <u><b>null</b></u> was <u><b>null</b></u>. The <u><b>null</b></u> was so cought up in the <u><b>null</b></u>; and when at last he did stop. the <u><b>null</b></u> was near the goal. The <u><b>null</b></u> now ran his swiftest, but he could not overtake the <u><b>null</b></u> in time.
